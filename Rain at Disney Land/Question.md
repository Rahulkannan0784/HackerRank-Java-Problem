precipitation is measured using a rain gauge in millimetre per hour. Chef categorises rainfall as: • LIGHT, if rainfall is less than 33 millimetre per hour. • MODERATE, if rainfall is greater than equal to 33 millimetre per hour and less than 77 millimetre per hour. • HEAVY if rainfall is greater than equal to 77 millimetre per hour. Given that it rains at X millimetre per hour on a day, find whether the rain is LIGHT, MODERATE, or HEAVY.

# Input Format

• The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. • Each test case consists of a single integer X — the rate of rainfall in millimetre per hour.

# Constraints

• 1≤201≤T≤20 • 1≤201≤X≤20

# Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line, whether the rain is LIGHT, MODERATE, or HEAVY. You may print each character in lowercase or uppercase. For example, LIGHT, light, Light, and liGHT, are all identical.
